# YourShop (E-Commerce)



Apr 2021 â€“ May 2021

Project descriptionOne of my advanced side projects is YourShop E-Commerce web application that I have built for 2 weeks. It was really useful project to understand Django tools and try them on real project. It is full featured web application that has functions such as authentication, cart handling, reviewing, email confirmation, and payment calculation.
